I walk through the color jungle. I take out my adjective[a] canteen. There's a adjective[a] parrot with a adjective[a] noun[n] in his mouth right there in front of me in the adjective[a] trees! I gaze at his adjective[a] noun[n]. A sudden sound awakes me from my day dream! Apanther’s verb[v] in front of my head! I verb[v] his adjective[a] breath. I remember I have a packet of noun[n] that makes go into a deep slumber! I verb[v] it away from me in front of the noun[n] . Yes he's eating it! verb[v] away through the adjective[a] jungle. I meet my parents at the tent. Phew! It’s been an exciting day in the jungle.
